# try-spdlog

Trying out spdlog with cmake. I don't need much, but it would be nice
if I could easily and quickly:

  0. configure a logger very easily;
  1. output to multiple sinks from a single log statement;
  2. set the format for each sink independently; and
  3. set up a cmake configuration so that only my debug exe prints debug statements.

So far, this seems like a good way to go :D.
